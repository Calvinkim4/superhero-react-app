# description
React app showing different types of marvel characters, events/stories, and comics. Also shows details on characters, events, and stories. Was suppose to match-up marvel vs dc characters but there is no dc api. Superheroapi does have certain amounts of popular dc comic characters but not as much as marvel's database.
